# QueueSmart

A web application that helps organizations manage queues and appointments efficiently. Users can join queues, view wait times, and receive notifications, while administrators can create services and monitor queue activity.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/4353-group-20.git
   cd 4353-group-20
   ```

2. Open the application:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser, or
   - Use a local server (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000

     # Using Node.js
     npx serve .
     ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
